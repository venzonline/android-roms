<b>PROCEED WITH CAUTION</b>

<h1>Preparing your Phone to get Root</h1>

<b><i>- BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS PROCESS I WOULD HAVE A FULLY CHARGED BATTERY OR THE PHONE PLUGED INTO A POWER SOURCE -</i></b>

1 Format your phone's SD card to FAT32 mode:<br>
<blockquote>Hook your phone up to your computer using a USB cable and then wait for the notification to show up in your title bar of your phone.<br>
Click the notification, and then click "Mount".<br>
A new removable disk should show up on your computer. Right click it and select Format, and select FAT32 as the file system type.<br>
2 Download and unzip the RC29 image file, unzip the file and copy the "<i>DREAIMG.nbh</i>" file to the root of your SD card.  Confirm the name of the file is exactly this: <i>DREAIMG.nbh</i>
Location of the RC29 Image: <a href='http://android-roms.googlecode.com/files/DREAIMG-RC29.zip'>http://android-roms.googlecode.com/files/DREAIMG-RC29.zip</a>
3 Turn the device power off.<br>
4 Hold Camera button, and press Power button to entry bootloader mode.<br>
You should see a gray/white screen with instructions to flash your phone with the update on your SD card. If you don't see that, make sure you followed the instructions properly.<br>
5 As per the on-screen instructions, press the Power button to start the upgrade process.</blockquote>

<h3><font color='#FF0000'>DURING THIS PROCESS DO NOT DO ANYTHING TO INTERRUPT THIS PROCESS!</font><b></h3></b>

6 After the upgrade is finished, restart the phone (you can restart by pressing Home+Back)<br>
<br>
<b><i>- You have now successfully downgraded your phone which will allow you to gain root access -</i></b>
